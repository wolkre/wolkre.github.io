<title>Independent Project Proposal</title>

 <h1>Riley Wolk's Portfolio</h1>
<p>
For the Indepent Project, I will be creating my personal professional portfolio. I will be including all my work I have done inside and outside the classroom. My goal is to use this portfolio while I am applying for jobs. Right now, I work for the JMU Athletic Communications office so I will be including work I do for work but also have all the Interactive Design projects I have made throughout the SMAD curriculum. The site will be made through wordpress and will utilize a template that has Bootstrap. I chose to have this so that I can work on my Bootstrap skills while creating this project.
</p>
<p>
 I am applying for both technology and sport jobs right now so I want my site to appeal to both. For technology, I am considering both UX Design and Front-End Development positions. For the sports industry, I am applying to mostly Social Media positions while also looking at Sports Information Director positions.

<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>
 My target audience is potential employers, they are the ones that I want looking at my work to hopefully get a job. The site has to appeal to tech companies looking for UX Designers and Front-End Developers so this could be employees in senior positions or from Human Resourcess. For sports, I want to showcase my SMAD projects to show my technical skills and how well I pick up programs. I will include some of my best Instagram stories, graphics, and game recaps. I am fortunate enough to be close with my coworkers who have worked in the sports industry for years. They will be some of the people I talk to when conducting research.
